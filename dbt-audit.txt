To create a data quality framework for moving files from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket to a BigQuery database, similar to the one described for Snowflake, you can use Apache Beam for the processing pipeline. Here's a high-level outline of the solution:

Read from GCS: Use Apache Beam to read data from files in the GCS bucket.

Define Data Quality Rules: Implement data quality checks as transformations in the Beam pipeline. Some common rules include:

Date Format Check: Verify if date fields conform to a specific format.
Null Check: Ensure certain fields are not null.
Regex Pattern Match: Validate strings against regular expression patterns.
Range Check: Ensure numerical fields fall within a specified range.
Uniqueness Check: Ensure values in a certain field are unique.
Apply Data Quality Rules: As data flows through the pipeline, apply these rules and tag records that fail any checks.

Write Results to BigQuery: Write the original data and the results of the data quality checks into separate BigQuery tables. For failed records, you might store information about which checks were failed and why.

Schema Evolution: Design the system to accommodate changes in the schema of the incoming data.

Error Handling and Logging: Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to capture issues during data processing.

Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring for the pipeline and alerts for critical failures or data quality issues.

Remember, each rule can be a separate Apache Beam ParDo transform or a DoFn. The actual implementation will require a detailed understanding of the data structure and specific requirements of the data quality checks. Additionally, you'll need to manage the deployment and scaling of your Apache Beam pipeline, which can be done using a runner like Google Dataflow.

explain this Apache Beam concept in a beginner-friendly way!

Apache Beam is a framework for processing data in a variety of ways. Two common operations in Apache Beam (and in many data processing systems) are Map and FlatMap. Understanding these can be a bit confusing at first, especially if you're new to programming or data processing. Let's break down the concept of FlatMap with an example.

Understanding Map
First, let's talk about Map. Imagine you have a list of numbers, like [1, 2, 3], and you want to add 1 to each number. You would use Map for this. It takes each element of the list, applies a function to it (in this case, adding 1), and returns a new list with the transformed elements. So, [1, 2, 3] becomes [2, 3, 4].

The Limitation of Map
Map is great for changing each element in a list, but it always gives you back a list of the same size. What if you want to do something that could result in more or fewer elements? That's where FlatMap comes in.

Understanding FlatMap
Imagine now that instead of adding 1 to each number, you want to list all the numbers up to each number. So for 1, you just have [1]. For 2, you have [1, 2]. For 3, it's [1, 2, 3]. If you use a Map operation for this, you would end up with a list of lists: [[1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]. But what if you want all those numbers in a single list instead of a list of lists?

This is where FlatMap shines. It lets you take a single input (like a number) and transform it into a list of outputs (like a list of numbers up to that number). Then, it "flattens" these lists into a single list. So instead of getting [[1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]], you get [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3].

Summary
Map: Takes each element, applies a function, and returns a list of the same size but with transformed elements.
FlatMap: Similar to Map, but allows the function to return a list of elements for each input, and then flattens these lists into a single list.
I hope this helps clarify the concept of FlatMap in Apache Beam! If you have more questions or need further examples, feel free to ask.

I did not get this.. Pls explain me with another example : Understanding FlatMap
Imagine now that instead of adding 1 to each number, you want to list all the numbers up to each number. So for 1, you just have [1]. For 2, you have [1, 2]. For 3, it's [1, 2, 3]. If you use a Map operation for this, you would end up with a list of lists: [[1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]. But what if you want all those numbers in a single list instead of a list of lists?

This is where FlatMap shines. It lets you take a single input (like a number) and transform it into a list of outputs (like a list of numbers up to that number). Then, it "flattens" these lists into a single list. So instead of getting [[1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]], you get [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3].
ChatGPT
Of course! Let's try a different example to make FlatMap clearer.

A New Example: Words to Letters
Imagine you have a list of words, like ["cat", "dog"]. Now, suppose you want to break each word into its individual letters. So, "cat" would become ["c", "a", "t"] and "dog" would become ["d", "o", "g"].

If you use a Map operation for this task, you would end up with a list of lists: [["c", "a", "t"], ["d", "o", "g"]]. This is because Map applies a function to each element of the list (each word in this case) and creates a new element (a list of letters).

The Challenge
But what if you want all the letters from all the words in a single, flat list, like ["c", "a", "t", "d", "o", "g"]? This is not possible with just Map, because Map keeps the structure of the original list (a list of words in this case).

Solution with FlatMap
This is where FlatMap is useful. FlatMap works similarly to Map in that it applies a function to each element in the list. However, FlatMap takes it a step further: it can "flatten" the resulting lists into a single list.

In our example, FlatMap would take each word ("cat", "dog"), break them into letters (["c", "a", "t"], ["d", "o", "g"]), and then combine all these letters into a single list. So, instead of getting [["c", "a", "t"], ["d", "o", "g"]], you get ["c", "a", "t", "d", "o", "g"].

Summary
Map: Applies a function to each element but keeps the overall structure. In our example, it turned each word into a list of letters, resulting in a list of lists.
FlatMap: Applies a function to each element and then flattens the results into a single list. In our example, it turned each word into a list of letters and then combined all these lists into one list.
I hope this example makes the concept of FlatMap a bit clearer! Let me know if you have any more questions.

User
add one more example
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Let's use another example to illustrate how FlatMap works, this time with a situation involving sentences and words.

Example: Sentences to Words
Imagine you have a list of sentences, like ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"]. Now, you want to break each sentence into its individual words. So, "Hello world" would become ["Hello", "world"] and "Apache Beam" would become ["Apache", "Beam"].

If you use a Map operation for this, you would end up with a list of lists: [["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]]. Each sentence is transformed into a list of words, but you still have a list of these lists.

The Challenge
But what if your goal is to have a single list of all the words from all the sentences, like ["Hello", "world", "Apache", "Beam"]? Using just Map, you can't easily achieve this because Map maintains the original list structure (a list of sentences in this case).

Solution with FlatMap
Here's where FlatMap becomes really useful. FlatMap also applies a function to each element in the list (each sentence, in this case). But, unlike Map, FlatMap can "flatten" the results into a single list.

In our example, FlatMap would take each sentence ("Hello world", "Apache Beam"), split them into words (["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]), and then merge all these words into one single list. So, instead of getting [["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]], you get ["Hello", "world", "Apache", "Beam"].

Summary
Map: Transforms each element (sentence) into a new element (list of words), resulting in a list of lists.
FlatMap: Similar to Map, but it goes a step further by "flattening" these lists of words into a single list, providing a streamlined collection of all words from all sentences.
This example should help clarify how FlatMap differs from Map by not only applying a function to each element but also combining all the resulting elements into a single, flat list. Let me know if you'd like more examples or further explanation!

User
one real time example please 
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's use a real-world scenario to demonstrate how FlatMap can be applied effectively.

Example: Customer Reviews Analysis
Imagine you are working for an e-commerce company, and you have a list of customer reviews for various products. Each review is a sentence or two long. Your task is to analyze these reviews to find the most frequently used words, which will help in understanding customer sentiments.

The Data
Suppose your initial data is a list of review sentences like:

"Great product, very satisfied"
"Poor quality, not recommended"
"Excellent service, fast shipping"
Using Map
If you use a Map function to split these sentences into words, you would end up with something like this:

[["Great", "product", "very", "satisfied"],
["Poor", "quality", "not", "recommended"],
["Excellent", "service", "fast", "shipping"]]
Here, Map has taken each review and split it into words, but you end up with a list of lists, where each list is the words from one review.

The Challenge
Your goal, however, is to analyze all the words across all reviews together. You want a single list of words like ["Great", "product", "very", "satisfied", "Poor", "quality", "not", "recommended", "Excellent", "service", "fast", "shipping"].

Solution with FlatMap
FlatMap is perfect for this task. It takes each review, splits it into words (just like Map), but then it combines all these individual word lists into a single, flat list.

So, with FlatMap, your result would be:

["Great", "product", "very", "satisfied", "Poor", "quality", "not", "recommended", "Excellent", "service", "fast", "shipping"]
Now, you have a single list containing every word from every review, making it much easier to perform further analysis like counting word frequencies, identifying common adjectives, etc.

Summary
Map: Good for transforming each review into a list of words but keeps them as separate lists.
FlatMap: Ideal for not only splitting reviews into words but also combining all these words into a single list, which is more useful for comprehensive analysis across all reviews.
This real-world example demonstrates how FlatMap can be essential in data processing tasks where combining and flattening data is necessary for analysis. Let me know if this example helps or if you need more information!

what is wrong in below code : input = ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"]

import apache_beam as beam
with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    pipeline | beam.Create(input) |beam.Map() |beam.Map(print)


ChatGPT
The issue with the code snippet you've provided is that the beam.Map() transform is not being given a function to apply to each element of the input collection. In Apache Beam, beam.Map() requires a function to specify what transformation should be performed on each element of the input PCollection (the collection of data in the pipeline).

Here's a corrected version of your code, assuming you want to print each element of the input list. I will add a simple function to beam.Map() that just returns its input, which will then be printed:

python
Copy code
input_data = ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"]

import apache_beam as beam

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    (
        pipeline
        | beam.Create(input_data)
        | beam.Map(lambda x: x)  # Identity function: just returns what it gets.
        | beam.Map(print)
    )
In this code:

beam.Create(input_data) creates a PCollection from the input_data list.
beam.Map(lambda x: x) applies an identity function to each element of the PCollection. This function doesn't change the data; it just passes each element through.
beam.Map(print) then prints each element of the PCollection.
Note: When you run an Apache Beam pipeline that includes a print statement, the output may not appear as you would expect when running a standard Python script, especially if you're running on a distributed runner. The print statement is executed where the function is run, which might be on a different machine. For debugging purposes, you might want to consider writing outputs to a file or using logging instead of print statements.

User
but I did not get the output as per your response for Map function ?? what is the issue
ChatGPT
If you're running the Apache Beam pipeline and not seeing the expected output from the print statement, there are a few potential reasons and solutions:

Environment: Apache Beam pipelines can be run in different environments (runners). If you're running this pipeline in a local environment (DirectRunner), the print statements should output to the console. However, in a distributed environment (like DataflowRunner, FlinkRunner, etc.), the print statements might not output to your local console, as the code is executed on different machines.

Logging Instead of Print: In distributed environments, it's better to use logging instead of print to track what's happening. Here’s how you can modify your code to use Python's logging module:

python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam
import logging

input_data = ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"]

# Set up Python logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def log_element(element):
    logging.info(element)
    return element

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    (
        pipeline
        | beam.Create(input_data)
        | beam.Map(log_element)  # Log each element
    )
In this code, each element is logged using the logging.info method.

Pipeline Execution: Ensure that your Apache Beam environment is set up correctly and that the pipeline is executing as expected. Sometimes, configuration issues or environmental problems can prevent a pipeline from running correctly.

Debugging: To debug the pipeline, you can temporarily write outputs to a file instead of logging or printing. This can help verify whether the pipeline is processing data as expected.

Code Check: Double-check that the code is exactly as intended, without typos or syntax errors, and that all necessary packages are installed and imported.

Runner Specifics: If you're using a specific runner (other than the DirectRunner), check its documentation for any special considerations regarding logging or output.

Try using logging as shown above, and if the issue persists, you may need to delve deeper into the specifics of your Apache Beam setup and environment.

User
Im getting output as following : INFO:root:Hello world
INFO:root:Apache Beam   which is not a list of lists as per you explanation on map function topic
ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous explanation. Let's clarify the behavior of the Map function in your Apache Beam pipeline and why the output appears as it does.

In your pipeline, you're using beam.Map() to apply a function to each element of the input collection. Let's break down what's happening:

Input Data: Your input is a list of strings: ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"].

Beam Pipeline with Map:

The beam.Create(input_data) creates a PCollection from the input list.
The beam.Map(log_element) applies the log_element function to each element of the PCollection. In this case, log_element is a logging function that logs each element.
Output:

The output you're seeing (INFO:root:Hello world, INFO:root:Apache Beam) is the result of the logging function. Each element of the input list is being logged separately.
The reason you're not seeing a list of lists is that the Map function is not designed to create a list of lists in this scenario. Instead, it applies the log_element function to each individual element of the input list.
In other words, the Map transform is used to apply a function to each element of the input PCollection and produce a new PCollection where each element is the result of the function. Since the function you provided (log_element) simply logs the element and returns it, the Map transform doesn't alter the structure of the data.

If your intention was to transform each string into a list of words (thus creating a list of lists), you would need to modify the function used in Map. For example:

python
Copy code
def split_into_words(sentence):
    return sentence.split()

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    (
        pipeline
        | beam.Create(input_data)
        | beam.Map(split_into_words)
        | beam.Map(print)  # This will print each list of words
    )
This code would split each sentence into words, creating a list of words for each sentence. The final output would be lists of words printed separately. If you want to further flatten these lists into a single list, you would use FlatMap instead of Map.

User
my concern is your explanation is not working for map and flatmap transformers explanation ." Absolutely! Let's use another example to illustrate how FlatMap works, this time with a situation involving sentences and words.

Example: Sentences to Words
Imagine you have a list of sentences, like ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"]. Now, you want to break each sentence into its individual words. So, "Hello world" would become ["Hello", "world"] and "Apache Beam" would become ["Apache", "Beam"].

If you use a Map operation for this, you would end up with a list of lists: [["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]]. Each sentence is transformed into a list of words, but you still have a list of these lists.

The Challenge
But what if your goal is to have a single list of all the words from all the sentences, like ["Hello", "world", "Apache", "Beam"]? Using just Map, you can't easily achieve this because Map maintains the original list structure (a list of sentences in this case).

Solution with FlatMap
Here's where FlatMap becomes really useful. FlatMap also applies a function to each element in the list (each sentence, in this case). But, unlike Map, FlatMap can "flatten" the results into a single list.

In our example, FlatMap would take each sentence ("Hello world", "Apache Beam"), split them into words (["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]), and then merge all these words into one single list. So, instead of getting [["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]], you get ["Hello", "world", "Apache", "Beam"]."

ChatGPT
I understand your concern and I apologize for any confusion caused. Let me clarify how Map and FlatMap work in Apache Beam, and correct any misconceptions from my previous explanations.

Map
Map in Apache Beam applies a function to each element in a collection, and it produces a new collection where each element is the result of applying that function. However, it does not change the overall structure or the number of elements in the collection.

For example, if you have a list of sentences like ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"] and you use Map to split each sentence into words, you will get a collection where each element is a list of words. So, ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"] becomes [["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]].
FlatMap
FlatMap, on the other hand, can change the structure and the number of elements in the collection. It applies a function to each element, just like Map, but the function returns a collection of elements. FlatMap then "flattens" these collections into a single collection.

Using the same example, ["Hello world", "Apache Beam"], and applying FlatMap to split each sentence into words, you would get a flattened collection of all the words: ["Hello", "world", "Apache", "Beam"]. Unlike Map, which would produce a list of lists, FlatMap combines all the lists into a single list.
Example Code
Here's how you would implement these transformations in Apache Beam:

python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam

def split_into_words(sentence):
    return sentence.split()

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    # Using Map
    lists_of_words = (
        pipeline
        | 'Create sentences' >> beam.Create(["Hello world", "Apache Beam"])
        | 'Split words with Map' >> beam.Map(split_into_words)
    )
    # The result is [["Hello", "world"], ["Apache", "Beam"]]

    # Using FlatMap
    all_words = (
        pipeline
        | 'Create sentences for FlatMap' >> beam.Create(["Hello world", "Apache Beam"])
        | 'Split words with FlatMap' >> beam.FlatMap(split_into_words)
    )
    # The result is ["Hello", "world", "Apache", "Beam"]
Conclusion
Map is used when you want to transform each element in a collection but keep the structure of the collection the same.
FlatMap is useful when you want to transform each element into multiple elements and then combine those into a single flattened collection.
I hope this clarifies the difference between Map and FlatMap in Apache Beam. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need more examples.

Now, you have a single list containing every word from every review, making it much easier to perform further analysis like counting word frequencies, identifying common adjectives, etc.
ChatGPT
To create an Apache Beam pipeline for the customer reviews analysis example, we will follow these steps:

Read the data: We will start with a list of review sentences.
Split the reviews into words using FlatMap: This will transform each review into a list of words and then flatten these lists into a single list.
Count the frequency of each word: We will use a combination of beam.Map and beam.combiners.Count.PerElement() to count how often each word appears.
Here's the code to implement this pipeline:

python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam
import re

# Function to split sentence into words
def split_into_words(sentence):
    # Using regular expression to handle punctuation and split by whitespace
    words = re.findall(r'\w+', sentence.lower())
    return words

# Input data
reviews = [
    "Great product, very satisfied",
    "Poor quality, not recommended",
    "Excellent service, fast shipping"
]

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    word_counts = (
        pipeline
        | 'Create Reviews' >> beam.Create(reviews)
        | 'Split into Words' >> beam.FlatMap(split_into_words)
        | 'Pair Words with 1' >> beam.Map(lambda word: (word, 1))
        | 'Count Words' >> beam.combiners.Count.PerElement()
    )

    # Output the results.
    word_counts | 'Print Word Counts' >> beam.Map(print)
Explanation:
split_into_words Function: This function takes a sentence, removes punctuation, converts it to lowercase, and splits it into words.

beam.Create(reviews): Creates a PCollection from the list of reviews.

beam.FlatMap(split_into_words): Splits each review into words and flattens the resulting lists into one list.

beam.Map(lambda word: (word, 1)): Transforms each word into a key-value pair (word, 1) for counting.

beam.combiners.Count.PerElement(): Counts the occurrences of each word.

Output: The final output will be printed to the console, showing each word and its count.

Note:
This code will run using the DirectRunner (local execution) by default.
Remember, Apache Beam's print statements might not work as expected in a distributed environment. For production code, consider writing the results to an external sink (like a file, database, etc.).
The use of re.findall and lower() in split_into_words ensures that the word counting is case-insensitive and punctuation is handled correctly.
User
better if you can include logging module also 
ChatGPT
Sure, including the logging module is a good practice, especially for larger Apache Beam pipelines where you might need more sophisticated logging than just print statements. Here's the revised code with logging:

python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam
import re
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Function to split sentence into words
def split_into_words(sentence):
    # Using regular expression to handle punctuation and split by whitespace
    words = re.findall(r'\w+', sentence.lower())
    return words

# Function to log each word count
def log_word_count(word_count):
    # word_count is a tuple (word, count)
    logging.info(f"Word: {word_count[0]}, Count: {word_count[1]}")
    return word_count

# Input data
reviews = [
    "Great product, very satisfied",
    "Poor quality, not recommended",
    "Excellent service, fast shipping"
]

with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    word_counts = (
        pipeline
        | 'Create Reviews' >> beam.Create(reviews)
        | 'Split into Words' >> beam.FlatMap(split_into_words)
        | 'Pair Words with 1' >> beam.Map(lambda word: (word, 1))
        | 'Count Words' >> beam.combiners.Count.PerElement()
    )

    # Log the results instead of printing them
    word_counts | 'Log Word Counts' >> beam.Map(log_word_count)
Changes Made:
Logging Setup: The logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) call sets up basic logging configuration. logging.INFO means that INFO-level and higher messages will be logged.

log_word_count Function: This function takes a tuple (word, count) as input, logs it, and returns the tuple. It's used in the pipeline to log the word counts.

Logging in the Pipeline: Instead of printing the word counts, the pipeline now logs them using the log_word_count function.

Note:
Logging output may vary depending on your Apache Beam runner and environment. In a local environment, logs should appear in your console, but in a distributed environment, you may need to check the system's logs.
The beam.Map(log_word_count) step is primarily for demonstration and debugging. In a production pipeline, you might output to a file, database, or another data sink.
The logging format and level can be adjusted according to your needs.

To build a generic batch process that picks up files from a raw GCS bucket, processes them through the data quality rules, and writes the cleaned and error data to an analytical GCS bucket, you would typically use a combination of Google Cloud services. Here's an outline of how you can set up such a process:

Cloud Storage Buckets: Set up two Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets: one for raw data (raw-bucket) and one for analytical results (analytical-bucket).

Cloud Functions: Use a Google Cloud Function triggered by GCS events to start the process whenever a new file is uploaded to the raw-bucket.

Dataflow Pipeline: The Cloud Function triggers a Dataflow job which runs an Apache Beam pipeline to process the files.

Apache Beam Pipeline: Within the pipeline, you apply your data quality rules, separate the clean and error data, and write the results to the analytical-bucket.

Here's a sample structure for the Apache Beam pipeline:


import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions
import re
import pandas as pd
from apache_beam.io import fileio

# Replace 'your_project' and 'your_dataset' with your actual project and dataset names
project = 'your_project'
raw_bucket_path = 'gs://raw-bucket'
analytical_bucket_path = 'gs://analytical-bucket'

# Define the pipeline options
options = PipelineOptions(
    flags=[],
    project=project,
    runner='DataflowRunner',
    temp_location=f'{raw_bucket_path}/temp',
    region='your_region'  # replace with your GCP region
)

# ... Data quality check functions go here ...

def run_pipeline():
    with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
        # Read from raw bucket
        raw_files = p | 'ListFiles' >> fileio.MatchFiles(f'{raw_bucket_path}/*.csv')

        # Process each file with data quality rules
        clean_data, error_data = (
            raw_files
            | 'ReadFiles' >> beam.ParDo(fileio.ReadMatches())
            | 'ProcessFiles' >> beam.ParDo(ProcessFile())  # ProcessFile() is a DoFn that applies DQ rules
        )

        # Write clean data to analytical bucket
        _ = (
            clean_data
            | 'WriteCleanData' >> beam.io.WriteToText(f'{analytical_bucket_path}/clean')
        )

        # Write error data to analytical bucket

Let's say you have two types of CSV files landing in your raw GCS bucket:

sales_data_*.csv - Sales data files that contain columns like TransactionID, SaleDate, ProductID, Quantity, and Price.
customer_data_*.csv - Customer data files that contain columns like CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, and SignUpDate.
You want to ensure that:

For sales_data_*.csv:
SaleDate is a valid date.
Quantity and Price are positive numbers.
For customer_data_*.csv:
Email follows a valid email pattern.
SignUpDate is a valid date and is not in the future.
Your DQ configuration might look something like this:

python
Copy code
dq_config = {
    'sales_data_*.csv': {
        'dq_rules': [check_valid_date, check_positive_numbers],
        'target_location_clean': 'gs://your-analytical-bucket/sales_data/clean/',
        'target_location_errors': 'gs://your-analytical-bucket/sales_data/errors/'
    },
    'customer_data_*.csv': {
        'dq_rules': [check_valid_email, check_valid_past_date],
        'target_location_clean': 'gs://your-analytical-bucket/customer_data/clean/',
        'target_location_errors': 'gs://your-analytical-bucket/customer_data/errors/'
    },
}
The DQ rules are functions that take a record and return a tuple of (status, error_info), where status is a boolean and error_info is a dictionary with details about the DQ check failure.

Here's a high-level explanation of how the pipeline would work:

The pipeline starts and reads the dq_config to understand which files to look for and what DQ rules to apply.

The pipeline reads files from the raw-bucket that match the file patterns defined in dq_config.

For each file, the pipeline parses the CSV data into dictionaries. Each line becomes a dictionary where the keys are column names.

The pipeline applies the DQ rules to each record. If a record passes all the DQ checks, it's tagged as 'clean'. If it fails any checks, it's tagged as 'errors', and the details of the failure are noted.

The pipeline writes the 'clean' records to the clean/ subdirectory and 'error' records to the errors/ subdirectory within the respective target location specified in dq_config.

This process is done separately for each file pattern, so the sales data and customer data are processed using their respective DQ rules and written to their designated locations.

Output Format:

For clean records, the pipeline simply writes the CSV lines to the output file in the clean/ subdirectory.
For error records, the pipeline writes a more complex structure that includes the original record and the error details. The error output might look like a JSON file with entries like:
json
Copy code
{
  "record": {"CustomerID": "C001", "FirstName": "John", "LastName": "Doe", "Email": "john.doe@", "SignUpDate": "2024-01-01"},
  "errors": {
    "check_valid_email": "Email does not match pattern",
    "check_valid_past_date": "SignUpDate is in the future"
  }
}
In this JSON, record is the original data, and errors is a dictionary where each key is a DQ rule that failed, and the value is the error message.

The pipeline's job is to automate the application of these rules and organize the output so that downstream processes can easily use the cleaned data and address any issues found in the error data.
